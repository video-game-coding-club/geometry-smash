# GitPod

[GitPod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/video-game-coding-club/geometry-smash)
offers tight GitHub integration. All necessary `git` commands can be
run via the GUI instead of the command line. The game itself lives in
`game.html`. Just right-click on the file `game.html` and open it with
the "Mini Browser" and the game should start.
